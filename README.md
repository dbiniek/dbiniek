# Howdy! My name is David!

### I am learning about how Github works, playing around with new webhosting technologies, and trying to learn all I can about programming.

🖥️ I previously worked as a Linux Systems Administrator administering webhosting servers. I interfaced with customers to resolve issues relating to cPanel software and install custom software for my clients.

🌱 I’m currently learning the following platforms:
- Bash
- SQL
- Python
