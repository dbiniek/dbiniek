# Howdy! My name is David!

### I am learning about how Github works, playing around with new webhosting technologies, and trying to learn all I can about programming.

🖥️ I previously worked as a Linux Systems Administrator working with cPanel and bare metal webhosting servers. I now work for a software company working primarily with SQL.

🌱 I am currently learning the following platforms:
- Bash
- SQL
- Python
